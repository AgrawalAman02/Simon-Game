# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game! This project is a web-based implementation of the classic memory game "Simon." The game challenges players to remember and repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors.

## Live Demo

You can play the game live here: [Simon Game](https://agrawalaman02.github.io/Simon-Game/)

## Features

- **Start/Restart Game**: Start the game with any key press or by clicking the "Start Game" button.
- **High Score Tracking**: The game tracks your highest score and displays it after each game.
- **Time with High Score**: The game records and displays the time when the highest score was achieved.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Your scores, along with the times they were achieved, are saved in the browser's local storage. You can view your past records on the game page.
- **Clear Records**: A "Clear Records" button allows you to reset the stored scores and start fresh.
- **Hover Animation**: Buttons are animated on hover, enhancing the visual experience.

## How to Play

1. Press the start button or any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors that light up.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the same order.
4. Each level adds a new color to the sequence.
5. Try to remember the sequence as it gets longer—the game becomes more challenging as the sequence length increases.

Good luck and have fun!
